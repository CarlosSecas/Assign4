;Function name: isnan0     ;This avoids conflict with existing function with name isnan.

;Strategy: Online information about ucomisd states that if either of the two operands
;of ucomisd are nans then ucomisd set 1 into flag PF and will clear flag PF to 0 if 
;both operands are normal numbers (not nans).

;Now we need to discover what ucomisd placed into PF inside of rflags. Is it 1 or 0?
;Fortunately, there is an instruction that will copy the PF bit to rax, namely setp.
